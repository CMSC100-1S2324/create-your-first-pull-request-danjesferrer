Expectations:
- I expect our laboratory instructor to teach complex topic in CMSC 100 as easy as possible.
- I expect that I can grasp enough knowledge to build a web application after taking this course.
- I expect our laboratory instructor to be lenient in deadlines when uncertainties happens like typhoons, etc.
